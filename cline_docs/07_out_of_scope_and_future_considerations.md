# Out of Scope and Future Considerations

This document clarifies aspects of the Workshop-Foreman Management System that are explicitly outside the current development scope and highlights potential future enhancements.

## Out of Scope for Current Development

*   **Foreman Payout Mechanism:**
    *   While the system handles payments from workshop owners to the system for foreman services (e.g., via Stripe integration), the process of transferring funds from the system's account to the foreman's personal bank account or other payment methods is **not** part of the current development scope. This will be addressed in a later phase.

## Future Considerations and Enhancements

*   **Detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):**
    *   Develop a comprehensive ERD for the database schema, detailing all entities, attributes, relationships, and data types.

*   **Advanced Scheduling Features:**
    *   Implement more complex scheduling logic, such as recurring time slots, conflict detection, and automated assignment suggestions.

*   **Real-time Communication:**
    *   Integrate in-app messaging or chat features to facilitate direct communication between foremen and workshop owners.

*   **Geolocation Services:**
    *   Incorporate location-based services for more precise workshop discovery and foreman availability.

*   **Reporting and Analytics:**
    *   Develop dashboards and reporting tools for both foremen and workshop owners to gain insights into work history, earnings, expenses, and operational efficiency.

*   **Dispute Resolution System:**
    *   Implement a mechanism for resolving disputes between foremen and workshop owners regarding work quality, payments, or other issues.

*   **Multi-currency and Internationalization:**
    *   Support for multiple currencies and localization for different languages and regions.

*   **Integration with External Calendars:**
    *   Allow foremen and workshop owners to sync their in-app schedules with external calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).

*   **Gamification Elements:**
    *   Introduce badges, leaderboards, or other gamification features to encourage engagement and performance.
