# Foreman Features

This document outlines the key features available to Foremen within the system, designed to empower them in managing their work and professional profile.

## 1. Profile Management
*   **Create/Update Resume:** Foremen can create and maintain a detailed professional resume, including their skills, qualifications, and certifications.
*   **Past Experience:** Ability to list and describe previous work experiences, including roles, responsibilities, and duration.
*   **Skills & Expertise:** Highlight specific skills and areas of expertise to attract relevant workshop opportunities.

## 2. Workshop Discovery
*   **Browse/Search Workshops:** Foremen can browse through a list of available workshops or use search filters (e.g., location, specialization, required skills) to find suitable opportunities.
*   **View Workshop Details:** Access comprehensive information about each workshop, including their services, location, and any specific requirements for foremen.

## 3. Work Application
*   **Request to Work:** Foremen can send requests to workshops they are interested in working with.
*   **Track Application Status:** Monitor the status of their work requests (e.g., pending, approved, rejected).

## 4. Scheduling
*   **View Approved Timetables:** Once granted permission by a workshop, foremen can view the workshop's available work slots.
*   **Select Work Slots:** Choose and book specific time slots that align with their availability.

## 5. Payroll
*   **Track Completed Work:** Keep a record of all completed work sessions and associated earnings.
*   **Payment Tracking:** Monitor the status of payments from workshops (the system handles the payment from the workshop; the mechanism for transferring funds from the system to the foreman's personal account is outside the current scope).

## 6. Workshop Reviews
*   **Provide Feedback:** Foremen can submit reviews and ratings for workshops they have worked with, contributing to the community's knowledge base.
